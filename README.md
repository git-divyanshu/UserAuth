User Authentication Application
This repository contains a User Authentication Application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and bcrypt for password hashing to ensure user data is protected. This project demonstrates a robust and scalable approach to user authentication, featuring user registration, login, and protected routes to safeguard sensitive information.
